# Deep learning techniques for the classification of code vulnerabilities inÂ Smart Contracts using Self Attention Networks

This is project of two students of the master degree program in Artificial Intelligence of the University of Bologna.

Authors: [Gianluca Di Tuccio](mailto:gianluca.dituccio@studio.unibo.it), [Lorenzo Orsini](mailto:lorenzo.orsini4@studio.unibo.it)

The project compares three different deep neural networks to classify smart contract vulnerabilities: LSTM, self attention networks and rach self attention networks
